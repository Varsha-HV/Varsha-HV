V1: AC input signal (SINE wave with 0.9V DC offset and 50mV amplitude at 1kHz).

V2: DC supply voltage (1.8V).

R1: Load resistor (1kŒ©) to convert the amplified current signal into a voltage signal.

### Components details :
The circuit performs DC, AC, and Transient analysis, as specified by the simulation commands (.op, .ac, .tran). It amplifies the small input signal and produces an inverted output at V_out.
The circuit uses the TSMC 180nm technology library (tsmc018.lib), which provides accurate MOSFET model parameters for simulation. This library contains real-world transistor characteristics, such as threshold voltage, mobility, and capacitances, ensuring a precise representation of MOSFET behavior in analog circuits. By including this library, the simulation accurately reflects the amplification, frequency response, and transient behavior of the Common Source (CS) Amplifier.
 
 NMOS transistor (M1) is defined as CMOSN, referring to a specific  NMOS model from the TSMC 180nm library

From the stimulation : if l = 180nm , w = 1um ,V_out = 1.64727V  and I_d = 0.0001527A

if the power rating(power dissipiation across the resistor) is 50uW. given supply voltage is 1.8V .then the current through the resistor is given by :

I_d = power/Voltage = 50u/1.8 = 27.7uA

Since the calculated value dosent match the simulated value to get required current value we adjust w and l values

| Width   | Length  | Current |
|-------  |-------- |---------|
|  0.07u  |   250nm |  25.53uA|
|  0.25u  |   250nm |  37.26uA|
|  0.30u  |  250nm  |  41.94uA|
|  0.05u  |  250nm  |  27.7uA |


NMOS should be operated in saturation region , this can be confirmed by the DC operating point analysis

V_DS ‚â• V_GS-V_T

V_GS = V_G - V_S = 0.9V‚àí0V = 0.9V

V_DS = V_D - V_S = 1.8V‚àí0V = 1.8V

For saturation:
V_DS ‚â• V_GS-V_T

1.8 ‚â• 0.9V - 0.36624V

1.8V ‚â• 0.5337V

Since 1.8V is greater than 0.53375V, the MOSFET is in saturation. 

### Transient analysis

Transient analysis examines the time-domain response of the CS amplifier to an AC input signal (1kHz sine wave). It helps analyze amplification, signal distortion, and dynamic performance by simulating real-time behavior (`.tran 5m`).

### AC analysis

![WhatsApp Image 2025-02-15 at 13 03 11_c2339011](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0443722c-5f7c-4a5f-97f1-7b706b8d0a96)

The AC input signal has:

Frequency: 1KHz 

Amplitude: 50mV

DC Offset: 0.9V

This analysis determines the gain, bandwidth, and frequency response, helping evaluate the amplifier‚Äôs performance over different frequencies.

### Inference

DC Analysis: The MOSFET operates in saturation, with w/l controlling 
 I_d and transconductance. Proper biasing ensures stable operation.

Transient Analysis: The amplifier inverts and amplifies the signal. Higher 
w/l increases gain but raises power consumption and potential distortion.

AC Analysis: Gain depends on gm amd w/l A larger w/l  improves gain but reduces bandwidth, while a smaller w/l enhances stability.
