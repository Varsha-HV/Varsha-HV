From the stimulation : if l = 180nm , w = 1um ,V_out = 1.64727V  and I_d = 0.0001527A

if the power rating(power dissipiation across the resistor) is 50uW. given supply voltage is 1.8V .then the current through the resistor is given by :

I_d = power/Voltage = 50u/1.8 = 27.7uA

Since the calculated value dosent match the simulated value to get required current value we adjust w and l values

| Width   | Length  | Current |
|-------  |-------- |---------|
|  0.07u  |   250nm |  25.53uA|
|  0.25u  |   250nm |  37.26uA|
|  0.30u  |  250nm  |  41.94uA|
|  0.05u  |  250nm  |  27.7uA |


NMOS should be operated in saturation region , this can be confirmed by the DC operating point analysis

V_DS ‚â• V_GS-V_T

V_GS = V_G - V_S = 0.9V‚àí0V = 0.9V

V_DS = V_D - V_S = 1.8V‚àí0V = 1.8V

For saturation:
V_DS ‚â• V_GS-V_T

1.8 ‚â• 0.9V - 0.36624V

1.8V ‚â• 0.5337V

Since 1.8V is greater than 0.53375V, the MOSFET is in saturation.

This analysis determines the gain, bandwidth, and frequency response, helping evaluate the amplifier‚Äôs performance over different frequencies.

##  Inference

DC Analysis: The MOSFET operates in saturation, with w/l controlling 
 I_d and transconductance. Proper biasing ensures stable operation.

Transient Analysis: The amplifier inverts and amplifies the signal. Higher 
w/l increases gain but raises power consumption and potential distortion.

AC Analysis: Gain depends on gm amd w/l A larger w/l  improves gain but reduces bandwidth, while a smaller w/l enhances stability.

## CS Amplifier with PMOS Load

##  Introduction 

In a Common Source (CS) Amplifier, a PMOS transistor can replace the traditional resistive load.

PMOS load CS amplifiers are particularly useful in high-gain analog circuits where improved performance and efficiency are needed, such as in operational amplifiers.

*Objective:*
To analyze the performance of a Common Source Amplifier with a PMOS load, focusing on improvements in gain, linearity, and efficiency.

##  Key components used and their roles

PMOS Transistor: Acts as the active load, replacing the resistor to improve voltage gain and linearity.

NMOS Transistor: Serves as the amplifying device in the common-source configuration.

Biasing Resistors: Set the appropriate operating point for the transistors to ensure proper function and amplification.

Power Supply: Provides the required voltage for circuit operation.

##  Transient analysis

<img width="960" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a8f46386-1346-42e7-88a8-ced3893ecef8" />

Transient analysis examines the CS amplifier's time-domain response to a 1kHz, 0.9V sine wave input (.tran 5m), aiming to characterize amplification, distortion, and dynamic performance.  However, due to potential DC operating point issues with the PMOS (M2), as detailed in the DC analysis section

##  AC analysis

<img width="960" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/732b2466-b104-4ff4-b002-8624a873fd33" />

AC analysis (.ac dec 20 0.1 1T) characterized the CS amplifier's frequency response.  A 0.9V AC input was used. Bode plots (gain and phase) will be presented. Key parameters (midband gain, cutoff frequencies, bandwidth) will be identified.
VOLTAGE GAIN IS 42db

##  INFERENCE

DC Analysis:  Reveals a potential PMOS biasing issue, with V_out unexpectedly high (1.76V) for V_G = 0.3V. This casts doubt on the validity of the identified operating regions for both transistors.  The primary inference is the need to correct the DC bias.

AC Analysis: Shows a frequency response, but the specific values of gain, cutoff frequencies, and bandwidth are unreliable due to the suspected DC bias problem.  The observed AC behavior should not be used for design purposes until the DC operating point is corrected.

Transient Analysis:  Indicates a distorted output waveform, likely a consequence of the incorrect DC operating point.  Any observations about amplification or dynamic behavior are unreliable at this stage.
